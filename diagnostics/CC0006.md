# Cause

A simple iteration using a `for` loop and it is not interacting
with the indexer anywhere but in a single place where it
accesses the array used in the for condition to assign it to
a variable, which is itself used isnde the `for` loop.

# Example


````csharp
var array = new [] { 1, 2, 3 };
for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
{
    var someNumber = array[i];
    //some code
}
````

# Code fix

A code fix will be presented to you that will transform the code:

````csharp
var array = new [] { 1, 2, 3 };
foreach (var someNumber in array)
{
    //some code
}
````
